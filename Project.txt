1. Web Scraping: Toronto Postal Codes
We will start the project by scraping the following Wikipedia page. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M

Objective:

Obtain the data inside the html page containing a list of Toronto postal codes in the form of table and transform the data into a pandas dataframe!

2. Coordinate Retrieval: Toronto Postal Codes
Objective:

Now, we will get the latitude and the longitude coordinates of each neighborhood in order to utilize the Foursquare location data later in the separate main project notebook.

3. Segment & Cluster Toronto Neighborhoods
Objective:

We will explore, segment, and group neighborhoods into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in Toronto City. As far as this project is concerned, we will use the Foursquare location dataset and use Foursquare API to access it.

Compile everything to acomplish the project's goal.
